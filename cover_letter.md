Dear Raiffeisen Research Team,

I am excited about the Research Innovation Hub role because it combines quantitative modeling, financial‑market analysis, and product‑oriented delivery of research for retail and private‑banking clients. This is exactly where I want to deepen my career: building robust, data‑driven models and turning them into clear, actionable research products.

In my master’s thesis, I evaluated the forecast quality of ARIMA‑GARCH models for cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, DOGE, SOL) and built a Python pipeline for time‑series forecasting, rolling backtests, and risk evaluation (VaR/ES). The work emphasized volatility modeling, automated model selection, and reproducible reporting—directly aligned with your mission to develop modern quant models and digital research products.

At Swisslife Select I work at the intersection of financing, risk analysis, and product development. As Product Owner for the financing squad, I align business needs with IT delivery, analyze sales/financing data, and provide management reports and forecasts. I am also part of the internal AI taskforce and the Investment Squad, contributing to asset‑allocation discussions and data‑driven use cases. This cross‑functional experience matches the collaborative, agile environment you described.

I have hands‑on experience with Jupyter and R Markdown and basic exposure to Power BI and Tableau, and I am comfortable with Git/Atlassian workflows and Scrum in my current PO role. Additionally, I am scheduled to sit the **CFA Level I exam on 19 August 2026**.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team’s quantitative research and digital product roadmap.

Sincerely,

Markus Öffel
