## Application — Research Innovation Hub, Raiffeisen Research

Dear Raiffeisen Research Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Research Innovation Hub position. The opportunity to develop quantitative models for asset class analysis, equity scoring, portfolio analysis, and asset allocation—while transforming these into accessible digital research products for retail and private banking clients—aligns precisely with my professional goals and technical expertise.

What particularly attracts me to Raiffeisen Research is your commitment to turning continuous innovation into superior customer experience. I am drawn to the collaborative approach between your Vienna-based team and the 13 CEE country units, which enables you to deliver timely, actionable research that genuinely serves client needs. This customer-centric philosophy resonates with my own professional values.

In my master's thesis at the University of Graz, I built an end-to-end Python pipeline evaluating ARIMA-GARCH model variants for cryptocurrency risk assessment across multiple asset classes (BTC, ETH, DOGE, SOL). This work involved automated model selection using AIC/BIC criteria, rolling backtests with multi-horizon evaluation, and risk quantification via Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) with Kupiec and Christoffersen backtesting. The project demonstrates my ability to implement robust time series and volatility forecasting models—competencies directly applicable to your team's quantitative research initiatives.

At Swisslife Select, I currently serve as Product Owner for the financing squad, bridging business requirements with IT delivery in an Agile/Scrum environment while analyzing sales and financing data using Python and SQL to produce management reports and forecasts. As a member of both the internal AI taskforce and the Investment Squad, I contribute to asset allocation discussions and design data-driven use cases. This cross-functional experience mirrors the collaborative structure you describe for the Research Innovation Hub.

I bring hands-on experience with Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown for automated reporting and dashboard creation, working knowledge of Git and Atlassian workflows (Jira, Confluence), and strong Scrum practices from my product ownership role. I am comfortable working with market data from various sources and preparing results for presentations and stakeholder communications in both German and English.

To further strengthen my quantitative finance credentials, I am scheduled to sit the CFA Level I exam on 19 August 2026. Additionally, I have recently completed the AI Engineer Core Track covering LLM Engineering, RAG, and AI Agents—skills I believe will become increasingly valuable for developing next-generation research products.

I am excited about the prospect of contributing to Raiffeisen Research's mission of delivering innovative, data-driven research products that create real value for clients. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in quantitative modeling, risk analysis, portfolio analysis, and cross-functional product development can support your team's objectives.

Sincerely,

**Markus Öffel**
